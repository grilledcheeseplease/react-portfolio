# React Portfolio

## Desctiption
I have put together a react app in the form of a portfolio and deployed it with heroku. Instead of using react routing the 'pages' are passed with state management. The landing page is the About Me page with a recent photo and short paragraph about me. Next is the Portfolio page where I have displayed 6 of my projects with links to sites, video walkthroughs, and the repositories. Followed by the Contact page where there is a form to provide your information so I can contact you at a later time. Finally there is the Resume page where I have provided a list of my experience. Additionally in the future I want to utilize react-confetti feature for my form submit button. Enjoy, and thanks for your time!
